Loan Approval Prediction Project
Project Overview:

This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other relevant factors. It uses a machine learning model and is deployed via FastAPI with a simple web interface.

Features: 

1.Predict loan approval status (Approved / Rejected)
2.User-friendly web interface
3.Real-time prediction using FastAPI backend
4.Integration of Pydantic for data validation
5.Handles missing and categorical data effectively 

Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing applicant information like:

Applicant Income
Co-applicant Income
Loan Amount
Loan Term
Credit History
Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area

Dataset can be found in app/dataset/loan_data.csv

Summary / Conclusion:
This Loan Approval Prediction Project demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated with a FastAPI backend and a web interface to provide real-time predictions. The project covers the complete workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It serves as a practical example of applying data science and web development skills together and can be further extended with additional features, model improvements, and deployment enhancements.
